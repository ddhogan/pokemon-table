# Pokémon Table

In this project, we catch 60 Pokémon and display their stats in a table.
The table is paginated to show 20 rows at a time and is filterable on type (ie "grass") using the select menu in the header.
Mean weight of these 60 Pokémon, and the name of the one with the greatest Base Experience, are reported in the header.

## Getting Started

  0. This project was developed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.17.0, so you'll want a version near that installed.
  1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the root of the project.
  2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
  3. Launch it in development mode with `npm start`, and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
      - The page will reload if you make edits.\
      You will also see any lint errors in the console.
  4. After stopping the development server (with `ctrl+c`), you can run the test suite with `npm test`.

The table should look something like this: <img src="./public/ScreenShot_Table.png">

## Additional Info
CSS library is [mini.css](https://minicss.org) with customizations.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts from CRA

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
